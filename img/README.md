# Avatar Images

This directory contains the avatar images used in the chat application.

## Required Images

The application expects the following avatar images to be present:

- avatar1.png
- avatar2.png
- avatar3.png
- avatar4.png

You can replace these with your own avatar images, but make sure to keep the same filenames or update the references in the HTML and JavaScript files.

## Recommendations for Avatars

- Use square images (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Recommended size: 200x200px
- Keep file sizes small (preferably < 50KB each) for faster loading
- PNG format with transparency is recommended

## Placeholder Avatars

For development and testing, you can use services like:

1. [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/)
2. [DiceBear Avatars](https://avatars.dicebear.com/)
3. [UI Faces](https://uifaces.co/)
4. [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/)

Or create simple colored circles with initials as placeholders.
